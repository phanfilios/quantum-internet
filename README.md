## WHAT THE IS QUANTUM-INTERNET

Quantum Internet is an emerging concept that describes a communication network system that uses principles of quantum mechanics to transmit information faster and more securely than traditional networks of the last 20 years. Unlike our current Internet, which uses bits to represent information in the form of 0s and 1s, the quantum Internet uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to quantum superposition.

### CHARACTERISTICS OF QUANTUM INTERNET 


It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, using superposition and entanglement to create communication channels that are nearly extremely secure. Quantum cryptography, such as key distribution (QKD), theoretically allows for invulnerable security. 


### QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT

It allows two particles to be correlated in such a way that the state of one instantaneously affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This can be used to transmit information more efficiently, and in theory, information could even be transmitted without the need for terrestrial or satellite antennas

###  SUPERPOSITION

Instead of transmitting information through bits, the quantum internet can use qubits, which can represent multiple states at once, allowing for greater data processing and transmission capacity.

## QUANTUM NETWORKS

It is possible to establish networks that connect multiple quantum nodes, enabling quantum transmission, which allows long-distance quantum communication and the exchange of information around the world.

## QUANTUM TELEPORTATION

It allows us to transfer the state of a qubit from one place to another without physically moving the qubits themselves. This is crucial for transmission, as without it, the transfer of quantum information would not be efficient.

## CONTROLLED DECOHERENCE

As quantum information is transmitted, it is necessary to control decoherence (loss of quantum information) to maintain the integrity of quantum states during transmission

## QUANTUM PROTOCOL

It is the development of specific protocols for quantum communication, such as the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution, which take advantage of the unique properties of the quantum system.

## INTEGRATED QUANTUM COMPUTING

The quantum Internet could work together with quantum computers that might be entangled with our central nervous system and connected to our brain, or they could be modest physical devices like quantum computers. These computers would be capable of running quantum algorithms over the network and accessing basic computational resources. In summary, in theory, it would be software almost similar to Windows or Linux, iOS, but specialized and adapted to the new quantum network.
