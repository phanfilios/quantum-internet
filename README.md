## WHA THE IS QUANTUM-INTERNET

Quantum Internet is an emerging concept that describes a communication network system that uses principles of quantum mechanics to transmit information faster and more securely than traditional networks of the last 20 years. Unlike our current Internet, which uses bits to represent information in the form of 0s and 1s, the quantum Internet uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to quantum superposition.

### CHARACTERISTICS OF QUANTUM INTERNET 


It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, using superposition and entanglement to create communication channels that are nearly extremely secure. Quantum cryptography, such as key distribution (QKD), theoretically allows for invulnerable security. 


### QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT

It allows two particles to be correlated in such a way that the state of one instantaneously affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This can be used to transmit information more efficiently, and in theory, information could even be transmitted without the need for terrestrial or satellite antennas

###  SUPERPOSITION

Instead of transmitting information through bits, the quantum internet can use qubits, which can represent multiple states at once, allowing for greater data processing and transmission capacity.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to execute the S.I.C.P, Personal Quantum Internet System, which seeks the implementation of experimental neural implants/quantum microchips into a new network, which is the quantum network, as well as their entanglement with the old internet and also to create a more secure new network. In this repository, test versions of EEG simulation and the implementation of a neural network that works through the Ubuntu system will be stored. Information on the quantum internet will also be constantly updated.
